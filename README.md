# WolFin
A simple stock predictor.  </br>


### The Idea
A web application that queries an ML-algorithm to predict the next day's closing stock price.  </br>

### Why?
I want to learn more about the stock market.  </br>
I think this would be a good project to learn more about the stock market and AWS tools.  </br>
It will be a nice intro to machine learning. </br>
It will hopefully refresh my memory on REST concepts, JavaScript, Node, Express, and React.  </br>


### The Ideal
Provide a prediction of the closing stock price for the next day


### Progress Report
Project is completed and found at wolfin.org. </br>
Since it is expensive to keep an AWS sagemaker endpoint active, the predictor will be inoperable unless upon requests.
