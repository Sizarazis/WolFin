Just an idea.  </br>
A lightweight investment application that applies machine learning to the Yahoo Finance API.  </br>


### The Idea
A web API that uses machine learning to suggest what stocks to invest in on a given day, and provide projection metrics.  </br>
Provides filters so that companies I don't want to support aren't suggested (Oil and gas, weapons, privacy invasion, human rights, etc.).  </br>


### Why?
I want to learn more about the stock market and start an investment portfolio.  </br>
I think this would be a good project to learn more about the stock market and AWS tools.  </br>
It will be a nice intro to machine learning and possibly deep-learning. </br>
It will hopefully refresh my memory on REST concepts, JavaScript, Node, Express, and React.  </br>


### The Ideal
Provide a prediction of the closing stock price for the next day (5 days?)


### Implementation
1. Make a basic Node.js project with Express and React. (complete)
2. Connect to the Yahoo Finance API. (basic cases work/needs error handling)
3. Provide a basic front-end (complete, but I should remove superfluous stuff)
4. AWS: Learn the needed AWS machine learning stuff--using deepAR forecasting with sagemaker on historical stock market data
5. AWS: Prepare data for training
6. AWS: Train data
7. AWS: Model data
8. AWS: Test data
9. AWS: Deploy data
10. Connect the AWS machine learning deployment to my web application
11. Pretty the front-end up
