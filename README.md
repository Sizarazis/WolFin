Just an idea.  </br>
A lightweight investment application that applies machine learning to the Yahoo Finance API.  </br>


### The Idea
A web API that uses machine learning to suggest what stocks to invest in on a given day, and provide projection metrics.  </br>
Provides filters so that companies I don't want to support aren't suggested (Oil and gas, weapons, privacy invasion, human rights, etc.).  </br>


### Why?
I want to learn more about the stock market and start an investment portfolio.  </br>
I think this would be a good project to learn more about the stock market and Microsoft's Azure machine learning tools.  </br>
It will hopefully refresh my memory on REST concepts, JavaScript, Node, Express, and React.  </br>


### The Ideal
Buy: Run algorithm every day on all the public listings and provide a score from 0-100 on whether to buy.  </br>
Sell: Run algorithm every day on all of your owned stocks and provide a score from 0-100 on whether to sell.  </br>


### Implementation
1. Make a basic Node.js project with Express and React.
2. Connect to the Yahoo Finance API.
3. Build a system to categorize and display the API data.
4. Machine learning stuff!!!
5. ...
6. Profit!


### Thoughts
The AI needs to learn from previous stock market data. (this will be hard and a big learning experience for me on how to apply machine learning to a data set)  </br>
This could be a really complicated project so I need to hone in on an achievable base first.  </br>
It would be cool to use natural language processing to have an AI judge how articles about a company would effect its stock price. (But that seems like a huge endeavor).  </br>
Don't get down on myself if it doesn't work well. It won't. This is a learning experience.  </br>
